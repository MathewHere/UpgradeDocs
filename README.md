Microsoft Office  files (.doc, .xls, .ppt) conversion to latest format


I was searching for a tool /Script for converting the old office files with extensions (.doc, .xls, .ppt) to the latest standanrd (.docx, .xlsx, pptx)
There wasnt many tools available and once which are available were paid tools. So I created this basic C# tool for the same purpose.
PLease contribute to improve this basic app to a full fledged tool , which can be helpful for others.
