Microsoft Office  files (.doc, .xls, .ppt) conversion to latest format


I was searching for a tool / Script for converting the old office files with extensions (.doc, .xls, .ppt) to the latest standanrd (.docx, .xlsx, pptx)
There wasn't many free tools available. So I created this basic C# tool for the same purpose.
Please contribute to improve this app to a full fledged tool.
